GoSFSFS is inteded to be a super easy and quick to setup backup software, mainly for Windows, using a (s)ftp server, with default Backup rotations & multiples softwares at once.

1- Download GoSFSFS_installer.exe in /external/installer/ folder of repo  
2- Double click on it  
3- Go to %APPDATA%/Local/GoSFSFS/config.json

### Can I use it on Linux ?  
Well, yes, but no.  
I'll eventually make a Linux version (It's like ... 15 lines to change ?) BUT tbh if you're techy enough to use Linux, you should use another software.
